# Login-with-OTP-verification-system
Devloped an online login platform using Python that features an email-based OTP verification method.

Used python modules such as random( to generate One-Time-Password), and smtplib (to send mail). 

Generated One-Time-Password gets verified by the system and if it is incorrect invalid OTP appears on the system.

After verifying the One-Time-Password person can order certain things and get the list of the products he ordered.
